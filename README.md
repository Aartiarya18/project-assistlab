# 📌 Project: AssistLab-Inspired AI eCommerce Landing Page

A fully responsive and interactive **WordPress project built with Elementor**, inspired by a modern AI-based eCommerce assistant platform. This project showcases a sleek landing page layout featuring sections for AI chatbot features, personalized product recommendations, customer support tools, platform integrations, testimonial display, and a calendar-based scheduling interface.

The entire website was designed from scratch without using a pre-made theme, and later **converted into a static website** using a WordPress plugin for performance and easy deployment.
